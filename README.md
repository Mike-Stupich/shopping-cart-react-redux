# shopping-cart-react-redux
Simple shopping cart react web app to familiarize myself with react-redux.
Includes browsing some items, adding them to a cart, and checking out these items.

Overall appearance of the app is currently very neglected. I may come back in the future to do more with this app, including fixing the appearance. However since this was strictly to learn redux before continuing onto solidity, I have left this for now.
